# Habit-Calendar
A habit tracking app

## About
This app is going to be the result of my necessities to track my habits and become a happier man. A bunch of other similar apps do already exist, but I want to create something new. Since I'm also taking the cs193p classes, this app is going to be my final project for the course.

## Features
* Creation of goals to be tracked (with as many days as the user needs to track)
* Prompts to ask/remind the user if the activity was executed.
* Listing and management of each goal.
  * A calendar view will display the days in which the user executed the particular task.
  * How many days are needed to reach the goal.
  * The longest streak for the habit.
* A today's widget to inform the app about the tasks, if they were executed or not.
