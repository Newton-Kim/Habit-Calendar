A habit tracking app.

This app is going to be the result of my necessities to track my habits and become a happier man. A bunch of other similar apps do already exist, but I want to create something new. Since I'm also taking the cs193p classes, this app is going to be my final project for the course.

The main features of the initial version:
* Creation of goals to be tracked (with as many days as the user needs to track)
* Prompts to ask/remind the user if the activity was executed.
* Listing and management of each goal.
  * A calendar view will display the days in which the user executed the particular task.
  * How many days are needed to reach the goal.
  * The longest streak for the habit.
* A today's widget to inform the app about the tasks, if they were executed or not.
